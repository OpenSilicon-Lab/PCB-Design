🔧 Open Silicon Lab: PCB Design Resources
This repository by Open Silicon Lab is a free, structured resource for learning Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design from beginner to professional level. It provides everything needed to get started — from foundational documentation to project-ready templates and Gerber file generation.

📘 What You’ll Find
docs/: Detailed PCB design notes (LaTeX + PDF)

slides/: Presentations for teaching or self-learning

projects/: Complete PCB design walkthroughs

gerbers/: Ready-to-fabricate files for sample boards

tools/: Calculator links, scripts, and setup guides

💡 What You’ll Learn
PCB design flow: schematic → layout → fabrication

Using tools like KiCad, LTspice, Saturn Toolkit, etc.

Trace width, impedance, and current-carrying capacity

High-speed design, differential pairs, and DRC setup

🛠 Our Mission
To democratize silicon by open-sourcing quality hardware education, especially in underrepresented communities. We aim to build a real, grassroots hardware movement by sharing professional tools, tutorials, and projects.
